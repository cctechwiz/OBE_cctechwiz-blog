Let me introduce myself...

My name is Josh Maxwell I am married to a strong, amazing woman and we have two beautiful girls. We live in New Mexico and love the warm weather and outdoor activities.

As far as my backstory goes... After graduating High School and serving a 2 year mission in Florian√≥polis Brazil for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I attended Southern Utah University (SUU) and earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with an emphasis in computer & network security. It was during undergrad that I married my longtime sweetheart, Jessica. After graduating we moved to Pittsburgh, PA for me to attend the Information Networking Institute (INI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I earned my Master's degree in Information Security (MSIS), with an emphasis in system level code security and exploitation. Our first daughter joined us while attending grad school, and our second just under a year ago.

I currently work as a software engineer at Sandia National Laboratories building mostly command line applications and system integrations to support cyber resiliency R&D, experimentation, and execution. One such project is <a href="https://github.com/netmeld/netmeld" target="_blank">Netmeld</a>, which a coworker and I have been working on for a few years now and have recently been able to open source.

I am on a quest to explore other software development domains. While I enjoy the work I am doing now I don't foresee myself doing this kind of work forever. This blog will help me document my journey as I experiment with other domains and try to find where I want to pivot to next. In addition to documenting my professional journey and interests, I also plan to include some of my hobby projects and interests as well.
